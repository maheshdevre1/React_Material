Que 1)How does React.js work?
1. React.js works using a component-based architecture and a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the user interface.
2. React divides the UI into reusable components.
3. It uses JSX to write HTML inside JavaScript.
4. React creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
5.When data changes, React compares the old and new Virtual DOM (this process is called reconciliation).
6. It updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, which improves performance.
7. React follows one-way data binding, where data flows from parent to child through props.
8. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders that component.
👉 Because of Virtual DOM and efficient updates, React applications are fast and scalable.
*)What is DOM ?
DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of an HTML document created by the browser. It allows JavaScript to access and modify 
the content, structure, and styles of a web page dynamically.
*)Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
The Real DOM is the actual browser representation of a web page, while the Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy maintained by React in memory. 
React compares the old and new Virtual DOM and updates only the changed elements in the Real DOM, which improves performance.

Que 2) What is JSX?✅ How is JSX Converted into JavaScript?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
Instead of writing complicated JavaScript to create elements, JSX makes code easy to read and write.
🧠 Simple Example
const name = "Mahesh";
const element = (
  <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
);
👉 {name} means we are using a JavaScript variable inside JSX.
👉 Curly braces { } are used to write JavaScript expressions inside JSX.
Browsers do not understand JSX directly ❌
So React uses a tool called Babel.
🔄 What Babel Does:
It converts JSX into normal JavaScript.
Example:
JSX Code:
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
Babel converts it into:
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, World!"
);
👉 React.createElement() creates a JavaScript object that represents the UI.
👉 Then React uses this to update the DOM.
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript used in React that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Browsers cannot 
understand JSX directly, so Babel transpiles it into regular JavaScript using React.createElement().

Que 3 What is a React Component?
A component is a small, reusable part of a user interface.
In React, everything is made using components.
👉 Think of components like building blocks (LEGO pieces) 🧱
You combine small pieces to build a complete application.
For example:
Header,Navbar,Button,Form,Footer
Each of these can be a separate component.
✅ Types of Components in React
There are mainly two types:
1️⃣ Functional Components
These are simple JavaScript functions.
They return JSX (UI).
With Hooks, they can manage state and lifecycle features.
Example:
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello Mahesh</h1>;
}
👉 Easy to write
👉 Mostly used in modern React
2️⃣ Class Components
These are created using ES6 class.
They can manage state and lifecycle methods.
Used more in older React versions.
Example:
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello Mahesh</h1>;
  }
}
👉 More complex
👉 Less used now (functional components + hooks are preferred)
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
A React component is a reusable building block of a React application that represents a part of the UI. There are two types of components: Functional components, 
which are JavaScript functions, and Class components, which are ES6 classes. With the introduction of Hooks, functional components can manage state and lifecycle 
methods, and are now commonly used.

Que 4) What are Props in React? 
Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent component to child component.
👉 Props are like function parameters.
👉 They help components communicate with each other.
🧠 Example (Functional Component)
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello {props.name}</h1>;
}
<Welcome name="Mahesh" />
Here:
"Mahesh" is passed as a prop.
Inside the component, we access it using props.name.
🧠 Example (Class Component)
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
👉 In class components, we use:
this.props.name
✅ What are Default Props?
Sometimes, the parent component does not pass a value.
In that case, default props provide a default (fallback) value.
👉 This prevents undefined errors.
🔹 Default Props in Class Component
Welcome.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest"
};
If no name is passed, it will show Hello Guest.
🔹 Default Props in Functional Component
function Welcome({ name = "Guest" }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
Here, "Guest" is the default value.
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are read-only and help make components reusable. Default props are 
fallback values assigned to props when no value is provided by the parent, preventing undefined errors.

Que 5) What is State in React?
State is data that belongs to a component and can change over time.
👉 It controls how a component behaves and what it displays.
👉 When state changes, React automatically updates (re-renders) the UI.
Think of state like:
Counter value
Login status
Form input value
API response data
🧠 Example (Functional Component)
import { useState } from "react";
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
Here:
count is state.
setCount() updates the state.
When state updates, UI updates automatically.
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
State is the internal, mutable data of a React component that controls its behavior and rendering. When state changes, React re-renders the component. 
In class components, state is updated using setState(), and in functional components, it is updated using the useState setter function. Since state updates are asynchronous, 
the functional update form should be used when the new state depends on the previous state.

Que 6) Difference Between Props and State in React?
🔹 Props
👉 Props means properties.
It is data that is sent from one component (parent) to another component (child).
Simple Points:
Props are read-only (you cannot change them).
They are used to pass data between components.
The child component cannot modify props.
Used in both functional and class components.
🧠 Easy Example:
If a parent sends a title to a child:
<Header title="Welcome" />
The Header component just receives and shows "Welcome".
It cannot change it.
🔹 State
👉 State is data stored inside a component.
Simple Points:
State can be changed (updated).
It is used to store dynamic data.
When state changes, the component re-renders automatically.
Earlier, state was only in class components.
Now (after React Hooks), we use useState() in functional components.
🧠 Easy Example:
A counter:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
When you click a button, count increases.
This change is handled using state.
🔥 Simple Difference in One Line
Props → Data comes from outside (Parent → Child)
State → Data is managed inside the component
🎯 Real-Life Example
Think like this:
Props = Gift given by your friend 🎁 (You cannot change what’s inside)
State = Money in your wallet 💰 (You can use or change it anytime)
If you want, I can also give you a small React example showing both together 😊
yes
Great 👍 Let’s see a simple example using both Props and State together.
🧩 Example: Counter with Title
👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Component (App.js)
import React from "react";
import Counter from "./Counter";
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter title="Simple Counter App" />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
✅ What is happening here?
title="Simple Counter App" is a prop
Parent is sending data to the Counter component
👶 Child Component (Counter.js)
import React, { useState } from "react";
function Counter(props) {
  // State
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Using Props */}
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      {/* Using State */}
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increase
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Counter;
🔍 Now Understand Clearly
🔹 Props
props.title
Comes from parent
Cannot be changed inside Counter
🔹 State
count
Stored inside Counter
Changes when button is clicked
Component re-renders automatically
🎯 Very Simple Understanding
Props	State
Passed from parent	Managed inside component
Cannot change	Can change
Read-only	Read & Write
