Que 1)How does React.js work?
Que 2) What is JSX? How is JSX Converted into JavaScript?
Que 3 What is a React Component ?

Que 1)How does React.js work?
1. React.js works using a component-based architecture and a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the user interface.
2. React divides the UI into reusable components.
3. It uses JSX to write HTML inside JavaScript.
4. React creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
5.When data changes, React compares the old and new Virtual DOM (this process is called reconciliation).
6. It updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, which improves performance.
7. React follows one-way data binding, where data flows from parent to child through props.
8. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders that component.
👉 Because of Virtual DOM and efficient updates, React applications are fast and scalable.
*)What is DOM ?
DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of an HTML document created by the browser. It allows JavaScript to access and modify 
the content, structure, and styles of a web page dynamically.
*)Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
The Real DOM is the actual browser representation of a web page, while the Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy maintained by React in memory. 
React compares the old and new Virtual DOM and updates only the changed elements in the Real DOM, which improves performance.

Que 2) What is JSX?✅ How is JSX Converted into JavaScript?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
Instead of writing complicated JavaScript to create elements, JSX makes code easy to read and write.
🧠 Simple Example
const name = "Mahesh";
const element = (
  <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
);
👉 {name} means we are using a JavaScript variable inside JSX.
👉 Curly braces { } are used to write JavaScript expressions inside JSX.
Browsers do not understand JSX directly ❌
So React uses a tool called Babel.
🔄 What Babel Does:
It converts JSX into normal JavaScript.
Example:
JSX Code:
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
Babel converts it into:
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, World!"
);
👉 React.createElement() creates a JavaScript object that represents the UI.
👉 Then React uses this to update the DOM.
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript used in React that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Browsers cannot 
understand JSX directly, so Babel transpiles it into regular JavaScript using React.createElement().

Que 3 What is a React Component?
A component is a small, reusable part of a user interface.
In React, everything is made using components.
👉 Think of components like building blocks (LEGO pieces) 🧱
You combine small pieces to build a complete application.
For example:
Header,Navbar,Button,Form,Footer
Each of these can be a separate component.
✅ Types of Components in React
There are mainly two types:
1️⃣ Functional Components
These are simple JavaScript functions.
They return JSX (UI).
With Hooks, they can manage state and lifecycle features.
Example:
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello Mahesh</h1>;
}
👉 Easy to write
👉 Mostly used in modern React
2️⃣ Class Components
These are created using ES6 class.
They can manage state and lifecycle methods.
Used more in older React versions.
Example:
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello Mahesh</h1>;
  }
}
👉 More complex
👉 Less used now (functional components + hooks are preferred)
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
A React component is a reusable building block of a React application that represents a part of the UI. There are two types of components: Functional components, 
which are JavaScript functions, and Class components, which are ES6 classes. With the introduction of Hooks, functional components can manage state and lifecycle 
methods, and are now commonly used.
