React Interview Question and Answers
-------------------------------------
Que 1)How does React.js work?
Que 2) What is JSX? How is JSX Converted into JavaScript?

Que 1)How does React.js work?
1. React.js works using a component-based architecture and a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the user interface.
2. React divides the UI into reusable components.
3. It uses JSX to write HTML inside JavaScript.
4. React creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
5.When data changes, React compares the old and new Virtual DOM (this process is called reconciliation).
6. It updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, which improves performance.
7. React follows one-way data binding, where data flows from parent to child through props.
8. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders that component.
👉 Because of Virtual DOM and efficient updates, React applications are fast and scalable.
*)What is DOM ?
DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of an HTML document created by the browser. It allows JavaScript to access and modify 
the content, structure, and styles of a web page dynamically.
*)Difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
The Real DOM is the actual browser representation of a web page, while the Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy maintained by React in memory. 
React compares the old and new Virtual DOM and updates only the changed elements in the Real DOM, which improves performance.

Que 2) What is JSX?✅ How is JSX Converted into JavaScript?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
Instead of writing complicated JavaScript to create elements, JSX makes code easy to read and write.
🧠 Simple Example
const name = "Mahesh";
const element = (
  <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
);
👉 {name} means we are using a JavaScript variable inside JSX.
👉 Curly braces { } are used to write JavaScript expressions inside JSX.
Browsers do not understand JSX directly ❌
So React uses a tool called Babel.
🔄 What Babel Does:
It converts JSX into normal JavaScript.
Example:
JSX Code:
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
Babel converts it into:
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, World!"
);
👉 React.createElement() creates a JavaScript object that represents the UI.
👉 Then React uses this to update the DOM.
🎯 Interview Answer (Short & Professional)
JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript used in React that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Browsers cannot 
understand JSX directly, so Babel transpiles it into regular JavaScript using React.createElement().
